and trying every home remedy and lotion under the sun it has persisted. the skin is almost leather like and very thick from his face all the way down his arms chest and back and he develops painful lumps or nodules under the skin that grow and shrink at various spots along the neck front shoulder and upper arm. these lumps start the size of a pea and grow to small ping pong balls and then shrink again over the course of a few days time. he was referred to have an outpatient surgery early last week to remove one of these lumps so that they could perform a biopsy and find out what exactly is going on with him. he returned today to have his stitches removed and find out some preliminary results. the doctor very frankly said that he was sorry but they have lost the sample that they extracted from his body. no recourse was offered and my father left the office completely stunned at the situation after having the stitches removed. the surgery referral was covered by his medicare and supplementary insurance all but . . now this is not an obscene amount but we are by no means well off. but i find it very disturbing that my father is still left with no idea of what is wrong with him and now will most likely have to undergo another surgery in the near future. is there anything i can do reddit is this grounds for a negligence or malpractice lawsuit i know that this is no place

eager to leave the situation. i just have two reservations. one is that i do not know if i want to think about a serious future with a guy i met when i was nineteen and i feel like moving in together is a precursor to that. another is that we had been having difficulties lately due to how he was treating me due to his own insecurities. at one point i was so upset i was thinking about breaking up with him. but after a come to jesus talk a month ago he sincerely apologized to me and acknowledged that he was behaving wrongly ever since he has been making a marked effort to do better and it has

out again. i have not really dated very much . so here are my questions . i did not make a move last time because i felt like she is a conservative girl and also since i had not seen her in almost weeks i personally felt like holding off. that is ok right . when i first reached out to her it was via facebook. thus far we have only communicated about dates via facebook but we exchanged phone numbers when we were to meet up last time . should i message her on facebook or should i text her . i am thinking of either taking her to a cool art show or to my favorite park in our little city
