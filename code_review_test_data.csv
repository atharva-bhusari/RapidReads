"I am in a very happy relationship and a guy I work with flirted with me a few months back.  He said that he found me ""stunning,"" but he said it in a casual way in the middle of a conversation when we were consulting about something else that was fairly serious.  I was very uncomfortable with it and told my boyfriend about it, which then made him uncomfortable.  He said I did nothing wrong, which I agree with, and since then I've tried to avoid the co-worker as much as possible.

Also since then, it came out that he hooked up with a colleague at work and then treated her poorly, causing her to be so upset she quit the job.  I have noticed many many more ways that he is inappropriate, has horrible boundaries and moreso just has huge issues.  We work in the mental health field and I have a higher position and degree than him so it REALLY bothers me to see how he acts.

Today he asked if I would write a letter of recommendation for him to go to counseling school.  I personally think he could be a good clinician, if he had more training, so I think it's a great idea for him to learn boundaries, ethics, theories, etc.  However, I feel really weird about writing him a letter of recommendation, mainly because my boyfriend was uncomfortable with him flirting with me, and also because I don't think he has good judgement at the moment, but he could eventually have it with the proper training.  I'm a people pleaser so in the moment I said yes.  But now I feel awkward, what do I do?"," Guy at work hit on me, has horrible boundaries now he wants me to write him a letter of recommendation to go to school in the mental health field."
"I have a friend. 
Lets call her, Jen. because I like that name. 
Myself and Jen have been friends for a good few years now.
I'm also best friends with Tom. 
Jen kind of entered our circle of friendship, which is now a triangle.

Flash forward a year later. Jen has broken up with her boyfriend. 
I go in for the kill. Jen, turns me down, proclaims she just wants us to be friends. I agreed, hurt, but agreed. 
We kept this a secret from Tom. 

A month later, Tom has told me that he and Jen have been meeting (Making-out, Snogging, however you want to call it) for a few days. 
Tom regrets it, and distances him self from Jen.
 
Jen doesn't know that I know this. 

flash forward to present day. 
Jen is acting weird. calling him all day, to no reply. calling me when she needs me, to which I reply. 

Tom just wants to forget about her, forget about everything. 
Jen wants him. in the sack I believe. 
I've told her to leave him alone but she won't. 

I feel like shit."," My girl best friend, who I like, snogs my boy best friend. He regrets it, and wants nothing to do with her. "
"So I am 22 and have had a credit card for two years now, I have used it regularly and never missed a payment, and I have a job that pays me in official legal tender. So I think to myself I must have a sweet credit score, check equifax BOOM! 700.

Fast forward to me the next day: I stroll up to a banker say I want my credit line increased and my rate lowered because I have freakin awesome credit. They check my experian and I have a 627. My dad and I are named Platypus S. Christ and Platypus T. Christ respectively. SO my dad forgot to pay a bill for an emergency room visit he had, like 180 dollars. The collection agency reported it as my dad's problem to tansunion and equifax. They reported it as my debt for experian. 

Long story short this is B.S. I want to fix it. Called Experian and the collection guys. Experian said they would get right on it. The collection guys say I have to send a ton of info e.g. drivers liscense ss card copy of credit report, to fix their fuck up. 

I may be missing something here but I tink that they could probably just look at the reports they filed and see that it is two differnet people. Why do they need me to furnish information,isn't it their job to verify that it is my debt?"," collections can't make sense of credit report, trying to fix it. Don't know if collections is trying to bullshit me or what."
"Hi there i made a post a few hours ago about using a sub domain to sell things pretty quickly shot down as they claimed it looked unprofessional, completly understand where the Redditor are coming from. 

However i went ahead and made one on Big cartel, partly to just how my stock looked. So a while later and im finished with everything and im pretty pleased on how it looks. Basically just asking for a once over to make sure everything seems okay, spelling/punctuation, and if you think the watches are any good ?

About the sub domain, i literally have to sell about 6 before i can afford to upgrade and get a proper domain and stat tracking and stuff."," So if you want to sell something on my site, please let me know. i think im getting this guy a good deal. thanks"
"So there is this girl at my school that I have been hanging out with. Let's just say her name is X. She is a cool girl and a good friend, she is also an 8 on the hotness scale. Recently she asked me if I wanted to go on a date with her. I kinda like her and I would be willing to give the relationship a try. Sounds good right? Well here's the problem. My Mom's name is also X. For some reason this makes me uncomfortable. i told her this and she thinks I am being stupid. What do you guys think? Am I being stupid or is this normal?", I like a girl at school but my mom's name is also X. I think I am being stupid.
