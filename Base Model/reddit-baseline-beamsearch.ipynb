I even invited her on the trip with us. I have given her all of our dates so that she can travel around with us.\\n\\nThe plan was for me to stay on the 4th July and fly back on the 5th. Mum knew this. I told her I had booked a flight back already from the west coast to east coast (where she would pick me up and we would fly back to the UK together). She has gone mad at me because she can't believe I would book a flight when she told me she didn't want me flying on my own. At the time I had booked it she told me she wasn't gonna road trip with us. She knew the trip was happening.......how else was I to get home if I don't fly? \\n\\nI am fine flying on my own it doesn't bother me at all.

We have a trip planned this summer which involves me going over to him in the USA. This will be the second time I have actually been with him in person. I am flying from the UK with my mum to the east coast. The original plan was for me to fly over to my boyfriend in the west coast (my parents are holidaying on the east coast) but because my mum was freaking out so much about me going to meet my boyfriend i said we can all road trip there together. I even invited her on the trip with us. I have given her all of our dates so that she can travel around with us.\\n\\nThe plan was for me to stay on the 4th July and fly back on the 5th. Mum knew this. I told her I had booked a flight back already from the west coast to east coast (where she would pick me up and we would fly back to the UK together). She has gone mad at me because she can't believe I would book a flight when she told me she didn't want me flying on my own. At the time I had booked it she told me she wasn't gonna road trip with us. She knew the trip was happening.......how else was I to get home if I don't fly? \\n\\nI am fine flying on my own it doesn't bother me at all. I feel like I have done everything I can to make her feel comfortable with this trip and she is just trying to sabotage it. Thoughts??   \n","1  My landlord left a falsified message taped to my door for all neighbours to are pretending to be another tenant. \\n\\nEvidence: \\nShe used the same font and size that she uses for all her notes\\nOnly she would know where we live and correlate it with where we park\\nNeighbours have no problem with us \\n\\nWe requested from the property management group to have the video tapes looked at and they stated hey did not have time to go on a \"wild goose chase\" I want evidence hard evidence and they denied me. \\n\\nI want to pursue this further particularly  with the human rights board of Canada based in harrassment and predjusice that goes against the human rights code. \\n\\nThe letter calls us assholes, says we were raised in a barn, says because we are young we should be more competent, calls us pigs, days we make all the neighbours sick. \\n\\nIt is defamatory as it was pasted for everyone to see.

maybe once a month first she said it was stress from work then it was because we werent married finally got married and she said that she was not confident anymore and didnt like being naked over the last year she has lost some weight got into shape and had some surgery done to boost her confidence i was hoping that would help but she still has no interest then it was she didnt want to have sex because she was terrified of getting pregnant so i got a vasectomy still sex only once a month or so in the last years she has initiated sex twice every time i mention sex she says the only thing you care about is sex or im tired or work was terrible we did not even have sex for almost months after we got married i am at the point i dont know what to do it has had a huge effect on my confidence as well i love my wife and will do anything for her but for me this has a huge effect on our relationship i am at the point where i just want someone to love me and want me should i bring up couples counseling maybe talk to her doctor about medications i just dont know what to do anymore\n","\n","Summary:soseq wife never wants to have sex with me and its a huge problem for me

roommate works a minimum wage job so money is tight and does not get financial support from his parents one month he was unemployed and could not make rent so i covered for him since our landlords

in my name and he has no money often i even get groceries for him to try to save him money so he can pay rent it comes to a something like a month depending on if we get groceries i do not know how to handle the situation i know he does not have the money to pay me back but i do not want this to happen again and i do not want to get evicted i do not want to have to keep covering for his utilities either the part that gets to me is now he seems uncomfortable around me as a result of this so he makes it feel like we are not even friends anymore he is still can be nice but he is usually in a sulken mood and short when i approach him about it he always gets mad another factor is that our fourth roommate just left to pursue a new career and we had a very hard time finding a new fourth roommate a lot of people said i should just leave but i do not want to leave my friends high and dry i also do not want to leave because we are friends and i am worried it would impact if not ruin the

my roommate works a minimum wage job so money is tight and does not get financial support from his parents one month he was unemployed and could not make rent so i covered for him since our landlords threatened eviction it happened again recently and i had to cover a couple hundred for him or we were going to be evicted in a matter of days i also usually have to pay utilities since the bills are in my name and he has no money often i even get groceries for him to try to save him money so he can pay rent it comes to a something like a month depending on if we get groceries i do not know how to handle the situation i know he does not have the money to pay me back but i do not want this to happen again and i do not want to get evicted i do not want to have to keep covering for his utilities either the part that gets to me is now he seems uncomfortable around me as a result of this so he makes it feel like we are not even friends anymore he is still can be nice but he is usually in a <OOV> mood and short when i approach him about it he always gets mad another factor is that our fourth roommate just left to pursue a new career and we had a very hard time finding a new fourth roommate a lot of people said i should just leave but i do not want to leave my friends high and dry i also do not want to leave because we are friends and i am worried it would impact if not ruin the friendship what should i do honestly the most important thing here is not to get the money back but to fix the relationship and not lose any more how could i approach him should i \n","Original
